Ocean of Offering Clouds
A Light Offering Prayer
by Gatön Ngawang Lekpa

rin chen dangpö kongbu ni
This lamp, made of the finest precious metal,
tong sum khyön dang nyampé nang
Is as vast as the entire billionfold universe.
tsi mar chü kyi yong kangwé
It is filled completely with refined essence of butter,
kyil du dongbu ri rab tsam
And in its centre is planted a wick as large as Mount Meru,
tsuk la parwé mé ché yi
Set alight, to produce tongues of flame,
ngowo yeshé nga den la
Which are in essence the five wisdoms,
nampa nyima dungchur gyi
And, in appearance, blaze with the dazzling splendour
ziji barwé marmé di
Of a hundred million brightest suns.
chok chu namkhé kham kun khyab
This light pervades every realm in all the ten directions.
ö kyi long né kun zang gi
And out of its radiant expanse,
chö trin gyatsöi trin trowa
Emanate offering-clouds, like Samantabhadra’s,
si té bar du tak chöpé
To make gifts throughout eternity, until the very ends of time,
dak dang dak la drel tok kyi
So that I and all those connected to me,
mik yul shin sön chi chipé
The objects of my prayers, be they living or dead,
tsok nyi dzok shing drip nyi jang
Gather the two accumulations, purify the two kinds of obscuration,
lamé changchub nyur tob shok
And swiftly attain unsurpassable awakening.

This was composed by Gatön Vāgindra.1
