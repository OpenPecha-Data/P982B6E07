Prayer for the Long Life of Khyenrab Chökyi Özer
by Gatön Ngawang Lekpa

Namo guru mañjughoṣāya!
khyenpé yeshe drimé rab nyepé
You have discovered supreme immaculate wisdom-knowledge,
zabgyé chö kyi denyi künzik shing
And realized the nature of the Dharma, profound and vast,
lek shé özer tong gi trodu yi
Now through a thousand shining rays of excellent explanation,
duljé petsal kyong dzé shyabten sol
You nurture the lotus-garden of disciples—may your life be long!

tsultrim dakpé tsawa rab du ten
With the roots of your pure ethical discipline firmly planted,
tö dang sampé yaldab metok tra
The foliage and flowers of study and contemplation bloomed,
tsulshyin gompé drebu yur zawé
And branches are laden with the fruits of genuine meditation—
namdren paksam jönpa shyabten sol
Guide and teacher, wish-fulfilling tree, may your life be long!

palden lamé shyabpé yündu ten
Glorious guru, may your lotus-feet remain forever stable,
tuk kyi shyedön malü lhündrub né
May all your wisdom aspirations be spontaneously fulfilled,
khyen rab wangchuk jetsün sakyapé
And may the immaculate and noble Sakya tradition
ringluk drimé chok chur gyé gyur chik
Of the lord of perfect wisdom flourish and spread in all directions!

Thus, in response to repeated requests from the learned and disciplined Tsultrim Puntsok and
Losal Kunga Rabgye, this was written in Shedrup Dargye Ling, a great dharma centre and hub
for exponents of scripture and reasoning, by Ngawang Lekpa, a monk of Śākyamuni. Siddhirastu.
Maṅgalam.
